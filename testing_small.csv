"A good value. Works great with my iPhone4 and as a Skype headset with my iPad2. Fits my ears comfortably. Fast shipping, and arrived in US Mailbox about 5 days after order. Recommended."	1
"A great deal for the lot. Chargers all work & the wiring is good quality, no fraying as of yet."	1
A great item to have in your car that makes things much easier to talk to other people through this speaker.	1
"A great phone case. I ordered it as a gift for someone in my family and they love it. A lot better than what I expected. Protects phone, looks good and they like the feel of it. I'm always amazed how much money I save on good quality cases from Amazon."	1
A great price for this case. I bought several for each pants belt for the many changes I do each day. It is well built and last a long time. Great potection for my phone.	1
"A great product for office desk/home office desk use.PROS:1. Cool, beautiful design to look at and hold in your hand.2. Once paired, it sits on the desk and connects every time, without fail with my iphone.3. Great coverage - it works for about 35-40 ft even, and so within a small house, this handset will work. (I kept this in my office and it connects from the parking lot as soon as I arrive at office - a distance of about 50 ft!4. Clear voice (no change in tone unlike some bluetooth devices!)CONS:1. Not everybody needs it or can use it all the time. I only use it in my office (for the dual purpose, as an iphone charger and as the headset while in office). I can't think of using it at home as carrying the iphone is easier than carrying this headset.2. Too pricey!So, If you have a need for a desk phone that connects to your phone using bluetooth this serves the purpose admirably - a great product for this purpose.I haven't had issues with charging the phone (iphone 4S, Sprint) on this, though I must admit the connector is a little tight -so you have to carefully place it. I am using it for the last several months (iphone 3gs before this iphone 4s), and so far haven't had any issues with it.Sound quality is also good (there is a volume control on the headset) and the microphone does seem to pick up correctly at the right volume."	1
"A great product that fits snug in my ear. I have smaller ears so its hard to find an ear piece that fit comfortably, and Jawbone has done it right by providing two different ways to wear your Icon with different sized ear fits. Charges nicely, I can hear very clearly as well as the other person can hear me on the other end just fine. A great product!"	1
"A guy working at the local Verizon store recommended this case.  He said it's the one all the people in the store use.  I bought one, and I must say that it's excellent.  It clips easily to a belt (via a swiveling clip), it holds the phone securely, and it is covered with a nice textured, rubberized coating.  It offers protection whether the phone is in the belt case or out of it.You can't go wrong with this combo."	1
A lot better than the rubber one you can pickup in the Sprint store.  Nice matte black/rubberized finished ala classic Thinkpad laptops.  I would highly recommend this.	1
"A lot of folks have claimed to have tested this battery to it's limits... and now I'm going to make that same claim.  The greatest drain on any cell phone battery is when the phone is ""searching for a signal.""  I live and work in a rural area and couldn't wait to take my new Incredible to work to put the Seido to it's ultimate test.  I work a 13 hour shift and the day I took my phone with me was one of the days that I either didn't have a signal or was in an area where the signal is very poor.  After 13 hours of my new phone searching for a signal I still had 30 percent of the battery left!  I couldn't believe it.  I've had two other phones that would have been dead within 6 hours.  Add to the signal searching, me playing a game for awhile on breaks, constant waking the phone up and learning it's features, etc.  I couldn't kill this battery! If you own an Incredible you must own this battery too!  The extra thickness of the phone doesn't bother me at all.  I like the added weight and the thickness makes the phone much easier to hold by the edges. It's been a few days now since I bought the Incredible and this battery to go with it and I am very pleased with them both."	1
"A must have on my desk.  Bought this over a year ago and I would be lost without it.  Keeps the phone standing up and it's shape is universal for any make of mobile phone.  It is made of a flexible but stiff rubber and just works great.  I prefer the colored ones, as the plain black collects lint and shows everything sticking to it. Just thought I'd mention."	1
A necessary purchase if you have a smart phone and more than one battery.  I keep one battery in my phone and before it runs down I have charged another battery in the charger.  You can also charge the battery in the phone at the same time if necessary.  It does not get better.  I'm very happy with this item.	1
"A nice simple product that works well,doesn't come with a cord which is no big deal,their is a light on the unit that shows it is getting power,but not charging,but for the price it works great."	1
"A piece of plastic with a crease in the center so it quasi folds. Silicon ""feet'? Silicon scraps pushed on the so called feet. Sure, they don't slip, but as soon as you put any pressure on the iPod, the thing collapses. Junk. Pure, marketing junk. Nothing but a load of bollocks. If it were metal, it would be something but this is easily made from a piece of packaging plastic, I wish I had known how flimsy it would be. There's more effort spent on the company branding than on the materials. Never again."	0
"a pretty sturdy, durable and easy to apply screen protector, and a good price to have extras on hand in a pinch"	1
A really durable feeling charger (what else would Nokia put out??) It charges the phone pretty quickly for a car charger and I imagine I will have it for a while.	1
"A solid one star! Who are these people leaving 2,3,4,5 stars??? The entire thing is wrong. The headband was designed to fit giants apparently. The flexible mic has a mind of its own and NO (read ZERO) memory retention. One minute it's adjusted fine and the next it's up your nose or in your mouth. Yes it is comfortable. Why? It fits very loose! As I said it's for extra large heads. When worn over my baseball cap it's fine. The mic not staying in place and being so cheaply held on and unwilling to do anything you want it to though ruins this product for me. It's very cheaply made and I can't imagine it lasting from the thin cord to barely held on earpiece. Trust this review! I would encourage anyone looking for a headset to try anything else. I can't imagine anything being worse. I wouldn't give these away for free! Admittedly this was my first headset and maybe I am expecting too much, but I also have owned lots of cheap Walkman type headphones that were wonderful. Why is it so hard to attach a mic??? Hopefully Cellet has fired the person(s) responsible for this design FAIL."	0
"A tool kit all in one. Very handy set for use with my Ipod nano. Item received as described an in a timely manner, thank you"	1
A total waste of my money. It could not fit my phone as the supplier sent a damaged case to me. I threw it in the garbage. Waste of time and money.	0
"A total waste of time. Folks, learn the hard lesson I've learned, ONLY order items frm PRIME certified sellers. Ohterwise, you dont know what youre getting, spending your money like going to Vegas. Its a gamble."	0
"A very clever solution if you have a mini digital camera.  Super convenient as you don't have to remove the camera from the case. It's a wrap! Just unhook the Velcro, and you are ready for a snap.It works by utilizing the tripod socket under the camera. It doesn't matter if socket is at the center or off center, it is very easy to adjust. After making sure that the camera is tightly secured, then you wrap it like a burrito :) It will be open to the sides, but it will still be completely protected as the material extends beyond the length of the camera.One disadvantage is that you have to remove the case if you want to mount the camera to a tripod. Usually not the case for a small pocket point-and-shoot camera.  Also, it would be a great plus if it has a mini-pocket for additional memory card or battery.The wrap is black and elegant. Made of quality stretchable material. Made in China.This is one of the cheapest and most effective solutions to protect a small camera.  Perfect companion for my Fuji J28."	1
A very good and reliable phone to use. The phone is very easy to use and has a good networking abilities.	1
"A very good headset for my Motorola android phone. Works well for all voice commands. Ear piece broke, but one can buy new ones without buying the whole headset."	1
"A very legit car charger for anything that requires a Micro 5-pin USB male, works well for devices with/without recessed ports (I also have a Kindle, and it works perfectly for that as well)"	1
"A very tight squeeze for my HTC G2 Vision phone. If I needed to answer the phone, I'd have to fight to get it out of the case. Decent case for a much smaller phone. Forget about having a protective cover on the phone, it will be clearly bigger than this case. So I bought an over-sized case that fit perfectly."	0
A very trendy phone cover  it fit very smug and it is very fashionable ... Also the price was right	1
A waste of money. I followed the instructions yet constantly have air bubbles. I've repeated the process without success. Do not recommend.	0
A waste of my money I guess you get what you pay for ..I will not order anything else at the price I paid for.Very disappoint.It don't even work and I have a Samsung galaxy note 2 ..It don't work with my phone	0
"a. the built quality is so low its really scary to put ANY phone inside, does not stick to the windshield and probably will break after few days\weeks of ""use"".b. not recommended to use with iphone 5. the bottom pieces covers the headphones jack, and about 20% of the microphone and speaker cut-outs."	0
"A++ case! As I love trying out new cases!! I have about 20 cases! This one is good for grip and it absorbs falls, in case u drop ur phone!!! I like the color and texture. Very frilly which is good. However prefer a hard case I don't know why as it seems that the semi hard polymer crystal case is all around better. I got the ""Stealth Pedaror"" with the inside decked out with furry grip and the outtside deckedin carbonfiber. They say it has some sort of ion that doesn't effect the signal! Well, I'm here to say that it's BS! Everytime I have that case on I have one or two bars. Then I take it out and immediately, my signal goes from 1 or 2 rightback to 5. So that's all I'm saying about that!!"	1
"About this phone, I have only 1 complaint... Battery life!!!  Otherwise, perfect!  A mobile computer in  your pocket."	1
"about this product because of the low price.  The Amzer Luxe Argyle Skin Case completely blew me away.  I sometimes have problems with these ""soft"" cases not fitting correctly.  This was not the case here.  It fits like a glove, looks goood, is affordable, and provides adequate protection.  Highly recommended."	1
"Absolutely great cell phone, good looking great easy front look, but lockedsecurely in the back, so Welcome to Verizon, another unlocked but lockedcell phone.  I sent this one back right away, hated too, but did. and receivedmy refund within a few days.  Amazon is not at fault.  They purchase these fromVerizon and Verizon says they are unlocked and they are not.Trust Amazon they will always refund your money if you are not satisfied.  Ihated returning this nice product but I could not use it.Did not think about Geeks or Teenagers for unlocking same."	0
Absolutely love this charger charges very fast actually one of the fastest charges that I bought in a very long time	1
Absolutely no problems great price.  I love that I'm charging two devices with one outlet just makes things appear neater.	1
"Absolutely perfect for motorcycle helmets.  Keeps it small, and allows bluetooth to be used by phone.  Nice that it has a radio built in.  Sometimes you want to hear local stuff, and this allows you to do that."	1
"Absolutely served both my purposes- a loud two phone bluetooth headset that automatically connects to our cellphones when we arrive home.- loud and clear sound when watching Youtube or Amazon instant videos with an older laptop/phone/tablet etcThe Line In helps when using devices that lack Bluetooth!Haven't used it with the battery much at all, just tested once that it works. Been connected to AC semi-permanently since."	1
"Absolutely the worst screen protector I have ever used.  It is difficult to move your finger across the screen, it feels like you have some sticky substance on the face of your phone.  Perhaps with the iphone 4 one could use this on the back but on the front there are better ones out there.  I would stay away from this product as it is very very over rated."	0
"Absolutely, without a doubt - great phone!Most importantly, it has WiFi!!! You can always switch between cellular and WiFi and that's a huge money saver!!! I'm on the 'pay as you go' (AT&T;) type of plan, which is the most convenient way for me to stay connected, when I want to be... Having a regular cell phone plan for me personally, is not an option - I hate to be 'on the leash at all times'! Can't wait when Nokia releases Skype edition for 5800! I know it's coming! Battery life is awesome ... three days, always ON and still going. In spite what other people say about cheap looking, made in China and all that - I totally disagree. There's nothing wrong with its looks! Navigation's pretty simple and easy, unless you have banana shaped fingers?! Other benefits: 8Gigs micro SD card (up to 16!), headphones, strap and stand, USB cable, charger, etc.Reception's quite well, but it's all about the area where you live in, I assume. Haven't tried it as a GPS device yet, though. Check out Ovi Nokia Store too. Great apps for whatever you need."	1
Actually charges my iphone. Good product. I like it so far.I definitely recommend it. :)It really does work. Good good.	1
Actually no it kept turning off and on and i dont know the reason so yea it didnt work it was a really very bad one ! Sorry	0
"Affordable charging cables that fit the very tight micro USB socket on the Samsung Captivate as well as working fine with my Nook and other micro USB devices. At these prices, I am very satisfied because my mobile lifestyle demands that I have a half dozen short cords plugged in here and there."	1
"After 2 months of use it cannot be charged anymore, the charging port became very unusable. It is not a good purchase, however if you have the enough money to have different cases go ahead if not you prefer to keep away from this bad product."	0
"After 2 other LG phones that were buggy and had issues with dropped calls, I told myself I would NEVER buy LG again. But because I wanted a qwerty touch screen phone, my options were limited, so I thought I'd give LG one last try.I could not be more happy! This phone is amazing, touch screen is very responsive, call quality rivals landline quality, takes great quality photos, brilliant display screen, loud ringers, good sized qwerty keyboard for texting, I could go on and on!There are many ways to customize this phone to your needs, there are a multitude of settings. This is the phone I have been waiting for.I got a Samsung Impression last week, but wasn't entirely happy with the phone, but mostly unhappy with AT&T; service, many places I found myself having no signal, for a 3G phone in a major city, this was unacceptable.So I returned the phone and found myself searching for something similar, the Lg Envy Touch was similar, but better as far as features, I was just afraid to try another LG, but they have restored my faith.There a a few minor things I don't like about the Envy Touch, the vibration mode is not that strong, if you have the phone in a case, and your in a noisy place unable to hear the ringer, you need to rely on vibrate mode, but you can hardly feel it vibrate, my wife has an Envy 2, and the vibration is very strong, if it's on a table in vibrate mode, it will move when it rings several inches from where it was because the vibration is so strong, but the Envy Touch is not even close.Would also prefer a slide open instead of a flip, but not a big deal, just a preference. And lastly when texting, the beginning of a sentence does not start in caps, you must hit the shift key, every phone I had the sentence would start in caps, but again no big deal.The pros of this phone are many, the cons are few, there is no such thing as the perfect phone, but this comes pretty close.The Envy Touch is definitely a keeper and I highly recommend it!Update:12/9/09I've had this phone for 6 months now, and it's starting to randomly shut off, took it back to the Verizon store, they gave me a software update, but this didn't help.Also too, when I get text messages, sometimes when I flip open the phone to read my message the screen is blank, I have to close and open it several times before I see anything.I should not be having these problems after only 6 months :(Update: 1/4/10I am now on my 3rd Envy Touch, Verizon gave me a like new replacement, but it had the same problems as the first one, keeps shutting off by itself.So now I'm on my 3rd like new replacement, lets see what happens with this one : (I have once again lost my faith in LG phones, seems they are not built to last.Update : 4/16/10My 3rd Envy Touch died! Never again will I buy LG phones! Totally unreliable!"	1
After 2 seperate attempts- by this company to deliver the product-they asked for another opportunity. Well all 3 attempts have failed. I believe they did credit my account- but if you want something reliable and deliverable-go elsewhere.	0
"After 2 weeks my charger just fell apart while i was taking it from the plug , not a strong charger at all i would have asked for my money but it wasn't even worth it ."	0
After 2 weeks on my iPhone 4S it damaged my sleep/wake button.. Apple store replaced under warranty but advised me not to use cases like this that put stress on the buttons. I did us a razor blade to cut out that part and used until my rokform case came in..	0
"After 2 years of the iPhone with minimal personalization, no multiple apps, crummy reception and excessive dropped calls; I could not be happier with my Captivate. I have yet to have a call dropped, great screen, battery life is reasonable if you manage it. There is a bit of adjustment to it, but Apple is no longer telling me how and when to use my phone. It's light but sturdy. It's a shame this phone is not getting more attention."	1
"After 3 months of use I am disappointed to say that I had to completely change my review from 4 stars to one star. When hurricane sandy hit the east coast I was relying on this as an emergency power supply for my iPhone since our power went out. When I plugged my iPhone in it would start charging then stop, start then stop, start and so on and so on. I tried every different battery combination and my iPhone 4 never got fully charged luckily my computer was fully charged so I plugged my iPhone into its USB port. Overall I was disappointed in how reliable it was. The first day I got it it worked and I only used it one other time after that before the storm and it worked then. I got a mophie powerstation duo instead just in case there is another power outage. Much more expensive but worth it to avoid another incident like that. :-("	0
"After 6 months of use this charger still charges everything: GPS, cell phones, and car cam. The additional USB port allows friends who need usb plugs to fit their iphones a usable plugin."	1
